  abstract = {With the growing demand for accessible and scalable mental health care, immersive technologies offer different solutions for prevention and early intervention. This paper presents the preliminary work of a Ph.D. project within the framework of the EU funded THCS project titled Immersive Prevention Centers for Mental Health. This research explores the integration of eXtended Reality (XR) platforms within Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs) to enhance decision-making with data support in mental health management. It presents a framework that will collect, interpret and visualize behavioral and biometric data to support clinicians in real-time and retrospective reviews of patient activity. By incorporating Machine Learning (ML) and clinically approved scenario design, this project aims to improve early identification, personalize interventions and monitor treatment outcomes in immersive environments. The interdisciplinary approach brings XR, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and clinical expertise together to build a foundation for scalable and interactive mental health support systems.},

  abstract = {Mental health systems across Europe face persistent challenges in accessibility, resource limitations, and stigma. Vulnerable populations such as adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders and older adults at risk of depression often fall through the cracks of existing care structures. The IPC4MH (Immersive Prevention Centers for Mental Health) project proposes an innovative solution: immersive prevention centers built within the Metaverse, designed for secondary and tertiary mental health prevention. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, the project aims to co-design, implement, and evaluate scalable, engaging, and inclusive virtual environments that support early intervention and long-term mental health care. This paper presents the conceptual foundation, objectives, research direction, and methodological approach of IPC4MH.},
