abstract: 'Mental health systems across Europe face persistent challenges in accessibility,
  resource limitations, and stigma. Vulnerable populations such as adolescents with
  neurodevelopmental disorders and older adults at risk of depression often fall through
  the cracks of existing care structures. The IPC4MH (Immersive Prevention Centers
  for Mental Health) project proposes an innovative solution: immersive prevention
  centers built within the Metaverse, designed for secondary and tertiary mental health
  prevention. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, the project aims to co-design,
  implement, and evaluate scalable, engaging, and inclusive virtual environments that
  support early intervention and long-term mental health care. This paper presents
  the conceptual foundation, objectives, research direction, and methodological approach
  of IPC4MH.'
