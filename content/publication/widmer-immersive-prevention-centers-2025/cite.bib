 abstract = {Mental health systems across Europe face persistent challenges in accessibility, resource limitations, and stigma. Vulnerable populations such as adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders and older adults at risk of depression often fall through the cracks of existing care structures. The IPC4MH (Immersive Prevention Centers for Mental Health) project proposes an innovative solution: immersive prevention centers built within the Metaverse, designed for secondary and tertiary mental health prevention. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, the project aims to co-design, implement, and evaluate scalable, engaging, and inclusive virtual environments that support early intervention and long-term mental health care. This paper presents the conceptual foundation, objectives, research direction, and methodological approach of IPC4MH.},
