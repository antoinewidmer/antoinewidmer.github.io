abstract: With the growing demand for accessible and scalable mental health care,
  immersive technologies offer different solutions for prevention and early intervention.
  This paper presents the preliminary work of a Ph.D. project within the framework
  of the EU funded THCS project titled Immersive Prevention Centers for Mental Health.
  This research explores the integration of eXtended Reality (XR) platforms within
  Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs) to enhance decision-making with data support
  in mental health management. It presents a framework that will collect, interpret
  and visualize behavioral and biometric data to support clinicians in real-time and
  retrospective reviews of patient activity. By incorporating Machine Learning (ML)
  and clinically approved scenario design, this project aims to improve early identification,
  personalize interventions and monitor treatment outcomes in immersive environments.
  The interdisciplinary approach brings XR, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and clinical
  expertise together to build a foundation for scalable and interactive mental health
  support systems.
