      title: "Why IPCs?"
      text: |
        Health systems face long waiting times and fragmented access to mental-health services.
        **Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs)** extend clinical capacity by combining supervised
        group sessions in social VR with guided home exercises. IPC4MH focuses on **safety,
        accessibility, and evidence**—integrating with established care pathways rather than
        replacing them.
