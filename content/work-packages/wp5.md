## WP5 — Evaluation (Junior)

### Overview

WP5 focuses on the **evaluation of Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs)** designed for adolescents with **neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)**.  
It parallels WP6, which targets older adults with neurodegenerative conditions, but adapts the methodology and evaluation focus to the developmental and psychosocial characteristics of younger participants.  
Through interdisciplinary collaboration, WP5 aims to assess the **usability, feasibility, and efficacy** of IPC-based interventions for adolescent populations in Switzerland and Poland.

---

### Objectives

Evaluations in WP5 will mirror those in WP6 but focus on **adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders**, a population requiring innovative, multimodal therapeutic approaches (Astle et al., 2022; Agid 2022).  
Both adolescent and older adult populations exhibit **neurovascular abnormalities** critical to brain health (Ouellette & Lacoste, 2021), yet their treatment goals differ substantially.

- For **older individuals**, treatments emphasize **symptom management**, slowing disease progression, and maintaining cognitive and physical health.  
- For **adolescents with NDDs**, therapies prioritize **cognitive and emotional development**, **social interaction**, and **educational support**, addressing individualized symptom profiles.

Social and contextual factors play a central role in adolescent intervention success (Walker 2002; Penner et al. 2022).  
Consequently, the determinants of usability, feasibility, and efficacy differ between populations.  
WP5 therefore uses the adolescent case to test the potential and adaptability of IPCs across diverse mental health contexts.

### Description of Work

The evaluation framework for WP5 mirrors that of WP6, while focusing on **junior IPC implementations in Switzerland and Poland**.

#### Teams and Clinics

- **Switzerland — Junior IPC:**  
  - **Team:** Interdisciplinary collaboration between **HES-SO**, a newly appointed **PhD student**, and the **clinical-technical team at DiverSSity**.  
  - **Clinics:** Collaboration with *Libellules* and *Eliézer*, expert centers in diagnosing and treating **Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)** in adolescents.  
    These institutions cover both **secondary** and **tertiary prevention** levels.

- **Poland — Junior IPC:**  
  - **Team:** Interdisciplinary group from the **Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences (IPPAS)**, including one **full-time postdoctoral researcher** (experienced in multidata ML) and a **part-time data manager** for clinical and system-derived data integration.  
  - **Clinics:** *Tarczyn Community Psychological Support Center for Children and Adolescents (Tarczyn)* — a primary and secondary-level mental health facility employing two clinical psychologists.

### Evaluation Tasks

The evaluation is divided into three core dimensions: **usability & engagement**, **efficacy**, and **technical feasibility**.

#### A. Data Collection

**A1 — User Engagement, Usability, and Acceptability**  
- Instruments: Questionnaires, interviews with patients and practitioners.  
- **Switzerland:** DiverSSity and PhD student (HES-SO).  
- **Poland:** IPPAS and Tarczyn team.

**A2 — User Engagement and Usability (Behavioral Logs)**  
- Data from XR systems assessing behavioral engagement.  
- **Switzerland:** DiverSSity and PhD/HES-SO.  
- **Poland:** IPPAS Postdoc.

#### B. Efficacy (Quality of Life and Clinical Journey)

1. **Screening information quality** and **treatment adherence**, assessed via practitioner feedback.  
   - Both countries: Clinical teams.  
2. **Patient-derived data** (medical, interview, behavioral logs).  
   - **Switzerland:** Clinical teams, DiverSSity, PhD/HES-SO.  
   - **Poland:** IPPAS.

#### C. Technical Feasibility and Scalability

- **Metrics:** User performance indices and IPC system reliability indicators.  
- **Switzerland:** DiverSSity, PhD/HES-SO.  
- **Poland:** IPPAS (Postdoc).

---

### Data Analysis

- **Switzerland:** DiverSSity and the PhD student (HES-SO).  
- **Poland:** IPPAS Postdoc (lead) and data manager, ensuring inter-site integration and harmonization of data pipelines.  
This joint analysis will yield cross-national insights into the usability, efficacy, and scalability of the IPC approach.

### Deliverables

| ID | Title | Month(s) |
|----|--------|-----------|
| D6.1 | Junior IPC study protocol | M12 |
| D6.2 | Ethics approval | M15 |
| D6.3 | Experimentation and analysis (V1, V2) | M24, M36 |

### Summary

WP5 evaluates the **junior IPC prototypes** with a focus on adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders.  
It combines behavioral data, clinical metrics, and user feedback to determine the feasibility and efficacy of immersive prevention interventions.  
The cross-country design, involving Swiss and Polish teams, allows comparative evaluation of usability and therapeutic impact, advancing the project’s goal of developing **evidence-based, personalized, and scalable mental health technologies**.
