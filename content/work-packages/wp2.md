## WP2 — Co-creation and Design

### Overview

WP2 focuses on the **co-creation and participatory design** of several Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs) that will later be implemented and evaluated.  
It emphasizes human-centred, ethnographic, and co-design methodologies involving practitioners, researchers, industrial partners, and patients, ensuring that the envisioned prevention centers are grounded in both user needs and technological feasibility.

### Objectives

Our main objective is to design several IPCs that we can evaluate, using **user-centred approaches** that mix ethnographic (observations, interviews, focus groups) and **co-creation methods** (workshops with stakeholders, paper and VR — Shapes XR — prototypes).  

Nantes Université (NU) has solid expertise in applying these methods, which C2Care, DiverSSity, and HES-SO are also accustomed to.  

To achieve this, the WP will:

1. **Develop a common vision** of what immersive prevention centers in the Metaverse could be.  
   This long-term vision will be based on how the various partners — healthcare practitioners, researchers, industrial actors, and patients — imagine the immersive teleclinics of the future, informed by the current state of the art and the anticipated evolution of immersive technologies and virtual worlds.

2. **Define scenarios and use cases** for secondary and tertiary prevention centers, addressing two target populations across three countries.  
   This includes selecting the exercises from **C2Care** and **DiverSSity** that will be used in the implemented prevention centers (WP4).

3. **Define the project’s evaluation objectives** to ensure that the designed scenarios are both feasible and assessable during the project timeframe.  
   These objectives will help guide decisions, prioritize efforts, and serve as reference points throughout the project.

### Description of Work

All teams will collaborate to define the **common vision and design principles** for IPCs in the Metaverse.  
The **TECNIS prototype** ([Vigier et al., 2024](https://youtu.be/sdvYOWJwT44)) will serve as a point of departure.

Activities will notably include:

1. Conducting *field studies* in the Metaverse using **TECNIS** and other social VR platforms (e.g., VRChat, Horizon Worlds, Mesh, EngageVR).  
2. Testing existing environments developed by **C2Care** and **DiverSSity**.  
3. Writing a document that defines key elements such as economic and health stakeholders, patient and practitioner personas, and representative scenarios and journeys.

Subsequent steps will involve designing IPCs tailored to the selected **young and older populations**.  
Led by **Nantes Université**, all teams — including partner associations and patient groups — will refine the vision into detailed personas (varying by pathology, needs, and country) and design scenarios reflecting both **secondary** and **tertiary prevention** contexts.  

The designs will describe:
- The virtual spaces in the Metaverse (welcoming areas, consultation rooms, exercise rooms).  
- The existing environments to be reused (for juniors: from **DiverSSity** and **C2Care**; for seniors: from **C2Care**).  
- The web access components for user management and data-driven dashboards.

In parallel, the research teams will define **common evaluation objectives** by drafting evaluation scenarios and protocols.  
Coherence across all scenarios will be ensured through supervision by the NU postdoctoral researcher and extensive collaboration among all partners.

### Deliverables

| ID | Title | Month(s) |
|----|--------|-----------|
| D2.1 | Vision for IPCs in the Metaverse | M3 |
| D2.2 | Design documentation for junior IPCs | M6, M12, M18 |

### Summary

WP2 lays the foundation for the project’s **user-centred design strategy**, establishing a shared vision and framework for immersive prevention centers in the Metaverse.  
Through iterative co-creation, participatory design, and interdisciplinary collaboration, this WP ensures that the IPCs are **conceptually sound, technically feasible, and evaluable within the project’s timeframe**.
