### Overview

WP2 focuses on the **co-creation and participatory design** of several Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs) that will later be implemented and evaluated.  
It emphasizes human-centred, ethnographic, and co-design methodologies involving practitioners, researchers, industrial partners, and patients, ensuring that the envisioned prevention centers are grounded in both user needs and technological feasibility.

### Objectives

Our main objective is to design several IPCs that we can evaluate, using **user-centred approaches** that mix ethnographic (observations, interviews, focus groups) and **co-creation methods** (workshops with stakeholders, paper and VR — Shapes XR — prototypes).  

Nantes Université (NU) has solid expertise in applying these methods, which C2Care, DiverSSity, and HES-SO are also accustomed to.  

To achieve this, the WP will:

1. **Develop a common vision** of what immersive prevention centers in the Metaverse could be.  
   This long-term vision will be based on how the various partners — healthcare practitioners, researchers, industrial actors, and patients — imagine the immersive teleclinics of the future, informed by the current state of the art and the anticipated evolution of immersive technologies and virtual worlds.

2. **Define scenarios and use cases** for secondary and tertiary prevention centers, addressing two target populations across three countries.  
   This includes selecting the exercises from **C2Care** and **DiverSSity** that will be used in the implemented prevention centers (WP4).

3. **Define the project’s evaluation objectives** to ensure that the designed scenarios are both feasible and assessable during the project timeframe.  
   These objectives will help guide decisions, prioritize efforts, and serve as reference points throughout the project.

### Summary

WP2 lays the foundation for the project’s **user-centred design strategy**, establishing a shared vision and framework for immersive prevention centers in the Metaverse.  
Through iterative co-creation, participatory design, and interdisciplinary collaboration, this WP ensures that the IPCs are **conceptually sound, technically feasible, and evaluable within the project’s timeframe**.
