### Overview

WP7 ensures that the project’s **results, tools, and methodologies** achieve visibility, sustainability, and real-world adoption.  
It covers four main pillars:  
(1) project **promotion and public communication**,  
(2) **integration of IPCs into health systems**,  
(3) development of **sustainable business models**, and  
(4) **scientific dissemination** through peer-reviewed publications and international conferences.  

Together, these activities support the long-term impact and scalability of the IPC4MH initiative across healthcare and research ecosystems.

### Objectives

The objectives of WP7 are to:

1. **Promote the project** and ensure visibility across professional, industrial, and public audiences through diverse communication channels (website, flyers, events, and media presence).  
2. **Prepare for large-scale adoption and integration** by defining pathways for the deployment of immersive prevention centers (IPCs) in healthcare systems.  
3. **Develop sustainable business models** and explore commercialization opportunities in collaboration with industrial partners.  
4. **Conduct public health and data studies** assessing the societal impact of IPCs and their interoperability with health information systems.  
5. **Disseminate scientific findings** to the academic community through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.  

These objectives aim to ensure that IPC4MH’s innovations are not only validated but also **economically viable, ethically sound, and clinically integrated**.

### Description of Work

WP7 is organized into four main tasks that translate strategic objectives into operational actions.

#### Task 7.1 — Project Promotion and Communication

- Develop and maintain a **project website** and social media presence with regular updates, blog posts, and downloadable resources.  
- Prepare **press releases, newsletters**, and organize **public demonstrations** and **professional meetups**.  
- Produce promotional materials such as **flyers**, **videos**, and **presentations** highlighting project achievements.  
- Ensure continuous engagement with the public, professional communities, and policymakers to strengthen project visibility and outreach.

#### Task 7.2 — Integration into Health Systems

- Collaborate with healthcare providers and **public health authorities** to integrate IPCs into **clinical workflows** and **data management systems**.  
- Develop **guidelines and interoperability protocols** ensuring seamless adoption into existing infrastructures.  
- Conduct **training sessions** and **capacity-building activities** for healthcare professionals to promote confident use of the IPC systems in routine practice.  
- Explore implications for data protection and regulatory alignment with GDPR and medical data standards.

#### Task 7.3 — Sustainable Business Models and Exploitation

- Co-develop **business and exploitation strategies** with SME partners (**DiverSSity** and **C2Care**) for IPC commercialization.  
- Define **licensing frameworks**, **partnership structures**, and **service delivery models** for sustainable adoption.  
- Conduct **economic and cost-effectiveness analyses** to demonstrate the IPCs’ viability and attractiveness to investors and healthcare providers.  
- Identify **pathways to scale-up**, including private–public partnerships and innovation transfer opportunities.

#### Task 7.4 — Scientific Dissemination and Research Impact

- Prepare and submit **high-impact scientific publications** to leading journals in digital health, XR technologies, and clinical innovation.  
- Present findings at **international conferences and symposia** to enhance visibility within the research community.  
- Encourage **cross-sector collaboration** by sharing data, insights, and methodologies with related European and global initiatives.  
- Maintain an open-science approach, ensuring that outputs are accessible through recognized repositories when possible.
