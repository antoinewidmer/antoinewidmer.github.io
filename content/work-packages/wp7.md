### Overview

WP7 ensures that the project’s **results, tools, and methodologies** achieve visibility, sustainability, and real-world adoption.  
It covers four main pillars:  
(1) project **promotion and public communication**,  
(2) **integration of IPCs into health systems**,  
(3) development of **sustainable business models**, and  
(4) **scientific dissemination** through peer-reviewed publications and international conferences.  

Together, these activities support the long-term impact and scalability of the IPC4MH initiative across healthcare and research ecosystems.

### Objectives

The objectives of WP7 are to:

1. **Promote the project** and ensure visibility across professional, industrial, and public audiences through diverse communication channels (website, flyers, events, and media presence).  
2. **Prepare for large-scale adoption and integration** by defining pathways for the deployment of immersive prevention centers (IPCs) in healthcare systems.  
3. **Develop sustainable business models** and explore commercialization opportunities in collaboration with industrial partners.  
4. **Conduct public health and data studies** assessing the societal impact of IPCs and their interoperability with health information systems.  
5. **Disseminate scientific findings** to the academic community through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.  

These objectives aim to ensure that IPC4MH’s innovations are not only validated but also **economically viable, ethically sound, and clinically integrated**.

### Summary

WP7 ensures that the IPC4MH project’s outcomes extend beyond research into **practice, policy, and market adoption**.  
By combining communication, integration, exploitation, and dissemination, it creates the conditions for **long-term sustainability**, **knowledge transfer**, and **European leadership** in immersive digital mental health.  
This work package positions IPC4MH as a benchmark for **translational innovation**, bridging scientific rigor, healthcare utility, and societal impact.
