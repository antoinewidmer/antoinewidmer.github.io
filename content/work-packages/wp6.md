### Overview

WP6 focuses on the **evaluation of the Immersive Prevention Center (IPC)** designed for **senior patients with neurodegenerative impairments**, assessing both patient and practitioner perspectives.  
The work package investigates multiple dimensions—**usability**, **acceptance**, **efficacy**, and **technical feasibility**—to determine the real-world impact of IPC-based interventions on older populations.

Evaluations will occur in two distinct phases to ensure rigorous validation of both usability and clinical outcomes.

### Objectives

WP6 evaluates the **efficacy, usability, and feasibility** of the IPC for **older adults** experiencing neurodegenerative impairments.  
Three key evaluation dimensions structure the work:

#### A. Patient and Practitioner Acceptance, Engagement, and Usability

1. **User engagement and usability:**  
   Ease of use, patients’ comprehension and satisfaction across activity types (solo exercises, collaborative tasks, group discussions, prevention information), and ergonomic comfort.  

2. **Acceptance:**  
   Intention to use the system and subsequent behavior of both patients and practitioners.  

**Measurement instruments:**  
- Patient and practitioner interviews,  
- Structured questionnaires,  
- Behavioral logs from XR systems (particularly for engagement and usability metrics).

#### B. Efficacy on Quality of Life (QoL) and Medical Journey

1. **Pertinence of information delivery** and **screening quality** (especially for secondary prevention).  
2. **Adherence to treatment or therapy**, aiming to prevent relapse or worsening of conditions (tertiary prevention).  
3. **Impact on mental health, self-care, medical journey, and overall QoL.**

**Measurement instruments:**  
- Patient-derived medical and psychological data (e.g., standardized mental health scales, symptom checklists),  
- Patient interviews and questionnaires,  
- Behavioral data from XR systems.

#### C. Technical Feasibility, Reliability, and Scalability

1. **User performance indices** assessing the IPC’s technical robustness and reliability.  
2. **Feasibility** for remote collaborative use, system scalability, and secure data management.  

**Measurement instruments:**  
- System-derived usability scores and error reports,  
- Comparative analysis across:
   - At-home vs. clinic-based sessions,  
   - Different activity types,  
   - User populations,  
   - Evaluation sites.

### Summary

WP6 conducts a **two-phase evaluation** of the Senior IPC, combining qualitative, behavioral, and system-level data to assess usability, acceptance, and clinical efficacy.  
Through collaboration between CHU Nantes and Nantes Université, the WP ensures robust experimental design, rigorous ethical oversight, and scientifically grounded analysis.  
Results from WP6 will provide empirical validation of IPC technology for neurodegenerative conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of **immersive healthcare interventions for aging populations**.
