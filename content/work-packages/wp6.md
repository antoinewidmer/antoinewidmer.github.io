### Overview

WP6 focuses on the **evaluation of the Immersive Prevention Center (IPC)** designed for **senior patients with neurodegenerative impairments**, assessing both patient and practitioner perspectives.  
The work package investigates multiple dimensions—**usability**, **acceptance**, **efficacy**, and **technical feasibility**—to determine the real-world impact of IPC-based interventions on older populations.

Evaluations will occur in two distinct phases to ensure rigorous validation of both usability and clinical outcomes.

---

### Objectives

WP6 evaluates the **efficacy, usability, and feasibility** of the IPC for **older adults** experiencing neurodegenerative impairments.  
Three key evaluation dimensions structure the work:

#### A. Patient and Practitioner Acceptance, Engagement, and Usability

1. **User engagement and usability:**  
   Ease of use, patients’ comprehension and satisfaction across activity types (solo exercises, collaborative tasks, group discussions, prevention information), and ergonomic comfort.  

2. **Acceptance:**  
   Intention to use the system and subsequent behavior of both patients and practitioners.  

**Measurement instruments:**  
- Patient and practitioner interviews,  
- Structured questionnaires,  
- Behavioral logs from XR systems (particularly for engagement and usability metrics).

#### B. Efficacy on Quality of Life (QoL) and Medical Journey

1. **Pertinence of information delivery** and **screening quality** (especially for secondary prevention).  
2. **Adherence to treatment or therapy**, aiming to prevent relapse or worsening of conditions (tertiary prevention).  
3. **Impact on mental health, self-care, medical journey, and overall QoL.**

**Measurement instruments:**  
- Patient-derived medical and psychological data (e.g., standardized mental health scales, symptom checklists),  
- Patient interviews and questionnaires,  
- Behavioral data from XR systems.

#### C. Technical Feasibility, Reliability, and Scalability

1. **User performance indices** assessing the IPC’s technical robustness and reliability.  
2. **Feasibility** for remote collaborative use, system scalability, and secure data management.  

**Measurement instruments:**  
- System-derived usability scores and error reports,  
- Comparative analysis across:
   - At-home vs. clinic-based sessions,  
   - Different activity types,  
   - User populations,  
   - Evaluation sites.

### Description of Work

Evaluations will be conducted over **two six-month phases**:

- **Phase 1 (IPC V1):** Focused on usability, feasibility, and acceptability.  
- **Phase 2 (IPC V2):** Focused on acceptance and efficacy outcomes.

Each phase will study two usage modes:  
- **One-shot sessions** (primarily secondary prevention).  
- **Longitudinal studies** (primarily tertiary prevention).

A total of **40 participants** will be recruited:  
20 for at-home use (with loaned head-mounted displays) and 20 for in-clinic participation.

---

### Teams and Roles

- **Lead Institutions:** *CHU Nantes (CHUN)* and *Nantes Université (NU)*.  
- **Personnel:**  
  - A **postdoctoral researcher or research engineer** (NU) to coordinate evaluation activities,  
  - A **PhD student** (NU) studying collaborative interactions within the IPC,  
  - A **clinical team** (CHU Nantes) responsible for patient recruitment, supervision, and on-site trials.

### Evaluation Tasks

#### Experimental Protocol Design and Ethics
- **Leaders:** NU Postdoc and CHUN Clinical Project Manager.  
- **Outputs:** Experimental protocols, informed consent procedures, and ethics submissions.

#### Data Collection

**A1 — User Engagement, Usability, and Acceptance**  
- Methods: Questionnaires and interviews (patients & practitioners).  
- Responsibility: NU Postdoc and CHUN Clinical Team.

**A2 — User Engagement and Usability (Behavioral Logs)**  
- Methods: Logging and behavioral analytics in XR systems.  
- Responsibility: NU PhD student.

**B — Efficacy (Quality of Life & Medical Journey)**  
1. Practitioner feedback on screening quality and treatment adherence.  
   - Responsibility: NU Postdoc and CHUN Clinical Team.  
2. Patient-derived data, interviews, and behavioral observations.  
   - Responsibility: NU Postdoc, NU PhD, and Clinical Team.

**C — Technical Feasibility and Scalability**  
- Indicators: User performance indices, cross-condition comparisons.  
- Responsibility: NU PhD student.

---

### Data Analysis

- **Qualitative and descriptive analysis:** Conducted by the NU Postdoc, focusing on interview and questionnaire data from patients and practitioners.  
- **Quantitative analysis:** Conducted by the NU PhD, focusing on behavioral logs and system performance metrics.  
- **Integration:** Mixed-methods and **multidata machine learning models** will combine qualitative and quantitative insights to model IPC engagement and outcomes.

### Deliverables

| ID | Title | Month(s) |
|----|--------|-----------|
| D5.1 | Senior IPC study protocol | M12 |
| D5.2 | Ethics approval | M15 |
| D5.3 | Experimentation & analysis (V1, V2) | M24, M36 |

### Summary

WP6 conducts a **two-phase evaluation** of the Senior IPC, combining qualitative, behavioral, and system-level data to assess usability, acceptance, and clinical efficacy.  
Through collaboration between CHU Nantes and Nantes Université, the WP ensures robust experimental design, rigorous ethical oversight, and scientifically grounded analysis.  
Results from WP6 will provide empirical validation of IPC technology for neurodegenerative conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of **immersive healthcare interventions for aging populations**.
