## WP3 — Core Technology

### Overview

WP3 focuses on defining the **technological foundation** and **architectural framework** required to implement both the junior and senior Immersive Prevention Centers (IPCs).  
It determines the components, technologies, and data infrastructures needed to create interoperable, scalable, and ethically compliant virtual prevention environments within the Metaverse.

---

### Objectives

This work package aims to **define the technology stack and architecture** for the IPCs, ensuring a robust, interoperable, and secure technical framework.

The main objectives are to:

1. **Define the general architecture of teleclinics in the Metaverse**, identifying the necessary service layers (e.g., social VR, data, web) and organizing the main components into a coherent system.  
2. **Select appropriate technologies** to implement a framework of sufficient quality to develop and operate prevention centers that can be reliably evaluated, while mitigating technical risks.  
3. **Determine which Metaverse technologies** to use for verbal communication, avatar management, and multi-user interaction.  
4. **Adapt existing VR/MR activities** (from C2Care and DiverSSity) so they can be experienced collaboratively — for example, in group sessions or under practitioner supervision.  
5. **Design and implement an “Activity API”** allowing content providers to integrate exercises within the Metaverse-based prevention centers.  
6. **Define and select data collection and management technologies** that support the project’s experimental, ethical, and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR compliance).  
7. **Leverage existing technical resources and libraries** available through industrial partners to accelerate development and ensure system reliability.

### Description of Work

WP3 will focus on defining the general architecture and selecting the necessary technologies for implementation.

- **Metaverse Technologies:**  
  The consortium will decide on the social VR technologies for audio communication, avatars, and data sharing.  
  Priority will be given to the reuse of **standard, well-supported technologies** and early decisions on software libraries, hardware platforms, and HMD providers.  
  The **TECNIS prototype code** developed at Nantes Université may serve as a reference implementation.

- **Activity Technologies:**  
  Existing standalone **Unity** or **Unreal** environments developed by **DiverSSity** and **C2Care** will be adapted to be **Metaverse-compatible**.  
  This will include integrating social VR elements, adding APIs for user behavior logging, and creating **interactive dashboards** for practitioners and users.  
  These developments will prepare the foundation for **WP4.1 (Implementation)**.

- **Data Technologies:**  
  WP3 will define methods for data logging, aggregation, and reuse within **real-time and longitudinal dashboards**, ensuring full compliance with ethical and legal standards.  
  The work will also explore **EU regulatory sandboxes** for testing Virtual Worlds technologies and healthcare-related services.

- **Collaboration and Roles:**  
  The technological partners — including SMEs and computer scientists from **HES-SO** and **Nantes Université** — will lead the work.  
  **CHU Nantes** will contribute to discussions concerning health data standards and interoperability requirements.

### Summary

WP3 establishes the **technical and architectural backbone** of the IPC4MH platform.  
By defining the architecture, activity interfaces, and data systems, it ensures that the IPCs are not only functional and secure but also interoperable, sustainable, and ready for large-scale clinical evaluation.
