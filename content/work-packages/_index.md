## Overview

The IPC4MH project is organized into seven interconnected **Work Packages (WPs)** that span coordination, co-design, technology development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination.  
Each WP contributes unique expertise and deliverables, ensuring scientific rigor, ethical compliance, and technological innovation.  
Follow the links below for detailed descriptions of each work package.

---

### [WP1 — Project Management](/work-packages/wp1/)
Ensures overall project coordination, progress monitoring, risk mitigation, and compliance with ethical and data management standards across all partners.

### [WP2 — Co-creation and Design](/work-packages/wp2/)
Develops a shared vision and participatory design framework for immersive prevention centers through ethnographic research and co-creation with practitioners, patients, and industry partners.

### [WP3 — Core Technology](/work-packages/wp3/)
Defines the architecture, APIs, and data frameworks enabling interoperable, multi-user immersive prevention centers, leveraging existing industrial VR/MR assets.

### [WP4 — Implementation of IPCs](/work-packages/wp4/)
Builds and iteratively refines three operational IPC prototypes—two for adolescents and one for seniors—integrating adapted VR/MR activities and conducting user-centered testing.

### [WP5 — Evaluation (Junior)](/work-packages/wp5/)
Evaluates usability, feasibility, and efficacy of the junior IPCs for adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders through multi-site studies in Switzerland and Poland.

### [WP6 — Evaluation (Senior)](/work-packages/wp6/)
Assesses usability, acceptance, and clinical impact of the senior IPC for patients with neurodegenerative conditions via phased evaluations combining behavioral, clinical, and system data.

### [WP7 — Dissemination, Exploitation, and Communication](/work-packages/wp7/)
Promotes project outcomes, supports large-scale adoption, develops sustainable business models, and disseminates scientific findings to the broader research and healthcare communities.
