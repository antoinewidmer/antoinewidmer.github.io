## Project Objectives

IPC4MH pursues the following specific objectives:

**To establish an evidence-based framework for immersive prevention centres.**  
This objective focuses on identifying user needs, ethical guidelines, and clinical requirements for XR-based mental-health prevention. It includes the analysis of target populations, prevention goals, and evaluation criteria to ensure feasibility, safety, and inclusion.

**To develop an integrated XR platform for multimodal prevention and monitoring.**  
This includes designing and implementing a modular technological platform that integrates sensing, XR content, and data analytics for real-time monitoring of user engagement and wellbeing indicators.

**To design and validate responsible AI models for mental-health support.**  
IPC4MH will train and validate interpretable AI models for affective and behavioural data, enabling personalised feedback, adaptation of preventive exercises, and explainable recommendations, aligned with ethical and GDPR principles.

**To conduct multi-site pilots addressing different user archetypes.**  
Two pilots will be carried out: one targeting younger users (junior archetype) and one focusing on older adults (senior archetype). Each pilot will assess feasibility, usability, engagement, and effectiveness through validated psychological and behavioural measures.

**To ensure dissemination, exploitation, and sustainability.**  
IPC4MH will deliver open-access materials, training resources, and exploitation strategies to foster long-term sustainability of prevention centres beyond the project duration.

## Expected Impacts

According to the proposal, IPC4MH will contribute to the following impacts:

**Improved accessibility of mental-health prevention services.**  
By providing XR-based prevention environments deployable in community, educational, and healthcare settings, IPC4MH increases reach and inclusion, particularly for underserved populations.

**Enhanced engagement and adherence to preventive interventions.**  
Through immersive, interactive, and adaptive XR experiences, IPC4MH promotes motivation, emotional regulation, and sustained participation.

**Strengthened digital capacity and multidisciplinary collaboration.**  
The project builds capacity among clinicians, educators, and developers by introducing XR and AI tools for prevention, and fostering interdisciplinary learning across Europe.

**Scientific innovation in multimodal data and AI for prevention.**  
IPC4MH generates new datasets and methodological advances in affective computing, multimodal sensing, and behaviour analytics applied to preventive mental-health contexts.

**Contribution to European digital-health policy and standardisation.**  
The project aligns with EU ethical and technical frameworks, contributing to the development of standards for responsible AI, data governance, and interoperability in preventive healthcare.

**Sustainable and transferable prevention models.**  
The results will inform long-term operational and business models supporting the replication of immersive prevention centres across EU member states.

## Alignment with THCS Expected Impacts

IPC4MH directly supports THCS objectives by:
- Strengthening health promotion and mental wellbeing through innovative digital tools.  
- Enhancing integration between technology developers, clinical researchers, and end-users.  
- Providing validated, sustainable frameworks for prevention and early intervention.  
- Contributing to the European Research Area by sharing open, reproducible data and methods.
