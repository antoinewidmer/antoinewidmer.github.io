## Executive Summary
**IPC4MH (Immersive Prevention Centers for Mental Health)** seeks to address the growing demand for scalable, accessible, and evidence-based mental-health prevention solutions.  
The project integrates **Extended Reality (XR)** environments with **sensing technologies** and **AI analytics** to foster early detection, self-awareness, and behavioural regulation across diverse user archetypes.  
Through a co-design process involving clinicians, researchers, patients, and technology partners, IPC4MH aims to demonstrate how immersive, data-driven interventions can complement existing healthcare pathways and promote resilience.

---

## Objectives
The project is structured around five interconnected objectives:

**O1 — Evidence-based co-design of immersive prevention scenarios.**  
Engage multidisciplinary stakeholders to define user needs, ethical principles, and interoperability requirements for XR-based mental-health prevention.

**O2 — Development of a modular XR platform for multimodal sensing and analytics.**  
Design and implement a flexible architecture integrating physiological, behavioural, and contextual data streams to support real-time monitoring and adaptive feedback.

**O3 — Responsible AI for personalised and explainable mental-health support.**  
Train and validate interpretable AI models for affective state estimation, engagement analysis, and prevention pattern identification while ensuring transparency and bias control.

**O4 — Clinical and psychosocial validation in multi-site pilots.**  
Deploy and evaluate IPC4MH in two archetypes — *junior* (adolescents and young adults) and *senior* (older adults) — measuring feasibility, acceptability, and early efficacy through mixed-methods evaluation.

**O5 — Dissemination, capacity building, and sustainability.**  
Promote knowledge transfer across healthcare, education, and policy ecosystems through open-access dissemination, training materials, and exploitation roadmaps.

## Expected Impacts

### I1 — Enhanced access to preventive mental-health services
IPC4MH will reduce geographical and social barriers to early intervention through scalable XR-based solutions deployable in clinics, schools, and community settings.

### I2 — Improved engagement and adherence
Immersive environments and adaptive feedback mechanisms will foster sustained user motivation, leading to better adherence compared with traditional prevention programmes.

### I3 — Strengthened digital and clinical capacities
Training clinicians and facilitators in XR and AI tools will enhance digital literacy, while cross-sector collaboration will improve multidisciplinary competences in prevention and wellbeing.

### I4 — Scientific and technological innovation
IPC4MH will advance multimodal AI research for mental health by producing novel datasets, benchmarks, and validation studies. All publishable outcomes will follow open-science principles.

### I5 — Policy and standardisation impact
By aligning with European frameworks on digital health ethics and interoperability, IPC4MH will contribute to emerging standards for responsible AI and mental-health technologies.

### I6 — Long-term sustainability and adoption
The project will deliver validated use cases, exploitation models, and cost-benefit evidence to support transfer to public services and SMEs, strengthening Europe’s preventive-health ecosystem.
