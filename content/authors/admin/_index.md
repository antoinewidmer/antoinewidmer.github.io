Prof. Antoine Widmer holds a PhD in Computer Engineering and is Professor of Computer Science at the HES-SO Valais-Wallis, where he leads the Applied Interactive Technologies (AppiTech) research group. His background in computer engineering provides a strong foundation for bridging hardware-level system design with high-level computational intelligence. His research explores the integration of immersive technologies (augmented, virtual, and mixed reality) with artificial intelligence and computer vision to develop interactive systems capable of understanding and responding to complex human behaviour in real time. By combining architectural efficiency, sensor fusion, and intelligent algorithms, his work seeks to advance the next generation of adaptive and context-aware humanâ€“machine interfaces for healthcare, training, and industrial applications.
